				<h1>Harnessing the power of Machines to empower people</h1>

				<p><strong>Do you ever find yourself</strong> in that moment of quiet meditation? That moment, when you understand what you are 
				capable of? You realize that the world could be conquered! Your dreams within your grasp! Live or Die, the choice is yours. A whole
				world of possibilities lies before you. Do you have what it takes? We think you do! We think you have your future within your grasp
				and we are dedicated to getting you there. Machines can do even more than we are capable of. We are hard at work, developing every 
				kind of machine to improve
				lives and save lives. We are developing drones, 3D Printers, Quantum computers, humanoid robots and are always open to customer
				requests.</p>
				<p>On the programming side, we are desiging targeting, prediction and encryption programs, compatible with humanoid robots. While
				we are still far from our goal, we are also developing sophisticated decision-making programs. We hope to get as close to
				sentience as robots possibly can. The final solution is on the horizon, and we hope to take the world there.</p>
				

				<h1>A Program is only as great as its programmers!</h1>

				<p>We employ software engineers, mostly back-end, database and mechanical/electrical robot engineers.</p>
				<p>Our primary focuses are on back-end logic, using C++ and Python. Database engineers will use SQL and various websites. 
				Robotic physics will be designed using matlab and various other tools that I don't understand, but the robotics guy does.</p>
