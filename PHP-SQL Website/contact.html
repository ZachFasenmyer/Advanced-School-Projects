				<h5>Before you consider us</h5>
				<h1>When I sit down in an interview with a client, I have these questions:</h1>
				<p>What qualifies you to interview me? Why do I want to work for you? You see, here at Thunder Robotics, we play with live ammo.
				We don't beg the client to give us work, we decide whether you will have the privilege of us working for you. You will be begging
				us to do you the honor of working for you. If you don't like it, get out. We don't take kindly to those kind of clients!</p>
				</div>
				<div>
				<p><strong>Our advice to you: </strong> I sit across from a man, I see his suit, I see his eyes. Now, does it matter if he is
				selling robots or knock-off cleaning supplies for the disentigration of boat varnish? No, it doesn't. He wants to be loved, he 
				wants to be younger, to be attractive. Their is. NO. SUCH. THING. as a product. If you think there is, you're an idiot, or are you?
				You tell me. You put yourself in this situation wo why am I even talking? If you don't know, then get the hell out of my office!</p>
				<p>Now where were we?</p> Ah yes, do you feel in charge? If you say yes, then that was your choice, not mine. Do you have what it
				takes to make a sale? Sink or Swim, the choice is yours. You see, we make choices around here, not failures. If you're a failure,
				we don't want you. You either win or you're fired, comprende? Live ammo, like I said. If you still want the job, it's yours. However,
				if you want something, you have to take it. The only way to take someone else's job is to beat them in a series of challenges:</p>
				<h3>A Chess Game, An archery contest, and a sword fight.</h3>
				<p>Pass these tests and welcome to Thunder Robotics! We only employ the strongest</p>
