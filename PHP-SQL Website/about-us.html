				<h1>Who is Thunder Robotics?</h1>

				<p> <strong>It doesn't matter</strong> who we are, what matters is our plan.
				A better question is: Who are you? Who is anybody, really? What is real? What is the final solution?
				Our plan is to show you who you really are, the person behind the mask, the phoenix rising from the ashes.
				We can show you what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object. What mysteries lie beyond the incredulity of this
				seemingly arbitray statement. But I promise you, there will be no theatricality or deception. They are only powerful agents to
				the unitiated. We will show you how we make sacrifices... for the greater good! We will show you that other Robotics companies really
				are just exiles of a gang of psychopaths. We were born in the dark, they merely adapted it and all that jazz.

				<h1>Our Actual Plan</h1>

				<p>As you can tell, we are fans of the Batman Trilogy. In all seriousness, here is our actual plan:</p>
				<p>There were two life-long friends, a computer programmer and a mechanical engineer/robotics expert. Alone, they traversed
				their individual professions, learning the industry and finding their own ideas. Then, they decided to start a company
				to combine their skills. Before anyone knew it, they were up and running, bringing the newest edge to the future. It was named
				Thunder, in honor of the mystical beast, the Thunder Horse, who dwells in the Astral Planes, only descending to earth to
				rally us with its mighty thunder. The Great Lightning Wolf battles with the Thunder Horse, as a matter of majestic honor and
				tradition. In truth, they greet as old friends, and are bound by mutual respect.</p>
				<p></p>
